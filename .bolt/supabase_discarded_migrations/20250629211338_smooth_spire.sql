  # AI Learning System Setup

  1. New Tables
    - Add content_data column to learning_modules for AI-generated content
    - Add is_active column to learning_modules for enabling/disabling modules
    - Add updated_at column to user_learning_progress for tracking last update

  2. Schema Updates
    - Add new columns to existing tables
    - Create indexes for better performance
    - Update constraints for new columns
