3. Content type (article, quiz, video, interactive)
4. Difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
5. Category (e.g., Budgeting, Investing, Savings, etc.)
6. Duration in minutes
7. XP reward
8. For articles: 4-5 sections with titles and content
9. For quizzes: 5 multiple-choice questions with options, correct answers, and explanations

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A JSON ARRAY:
