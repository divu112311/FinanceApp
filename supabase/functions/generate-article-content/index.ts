USER CONTEXT:
${JSON.stringify(userContext, null, 2)}

The article should have:
1. A compelling title
2. 4-5 sections, each with a clear heading and informative content
3. Practical, actionable advice the user can implement
4. Content appropriate for the user's experience level (${difficulty})

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A JSON OBJECT:
{
  "title": "Article Title Here",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section 1 Title",
      "content": "Section 1 content paragraphs..."
    },
    {
      "title": "Section 2 Title",
      "content": "Section 2 content paragraphs..."
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Make content practical and actionable
2. Use clear, concise language appropriate for the ${difficulty} level
3. Include specific examples and steps
4. Personalize based on the user's context when possible
5. Keep each section to 1-2 paragraphs (150-250 words)
6. Return ONLY the JSON object with no additional text`
