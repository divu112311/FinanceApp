Each question should have:
1. A clear question_text

3. The correct_answer (which must be one of the options)
4. A helpful explanation of why the answer is correct

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS A JSON ARRAY:

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Make questions relevant to personal finance
2. Ensure questions are appropriate for the ${difficulty} difficulty level
3. Include practical, real-world scenarios when possible
4. Make sure the correct_answer is EXACTLY the same as one of the options
5. Return ONLY the JSON array with no additional text`
